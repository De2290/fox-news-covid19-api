# fox-news-covid19-api
> REST API which returns Fox News Headlines


## Usage
Clone the repo and run the class file `target/classes/com/de2290/foxNewsCOVID19API/FoxNewsCovid19ApiApplication.class`.
This creates a server that listens for requests on port 8080. To get the headlines, use the endpoint `/getHeadlines`.


## Purpose
To follow up on my promise of turning the previous demo project into a proper API.
